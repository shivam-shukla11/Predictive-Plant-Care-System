- Tracks plant growth and provides alerts for potential issues
- Easy-to-use interface for monitoring multiple plants

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch optional)
- IoT sensors (optional: soil moisture, light, temperature sensors)
- Data storage: CSV / SQLite / MySQL
- Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
